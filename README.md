# Conscious Proxy Agent (CPA) - Academic Research Project

## Overview
This project implements and evaluates a **Conscious Proxy Agent (CPA)** - an identity-aware AI assistant with persistent memory and reasoning capabilities. The system is compared against a standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) baseline to demonstrate the benefits of identity persistence and contextual memory in decision-making tasks.

## Research Question
**Does identity persistence and structured memory improve AI decision-making quality compared to standard RAG systems for executive support tasks?**

## Key Features

### 1. Identity-Aware Agent
- Maintains persistent role identity (Chief of Staff)
- References company values and constraints
- Follows structured decision frameworks
- Learns from past decisions

### 2. Persistent Memory System
- Stores conversation history
- Records past decisions with reasoning
- Retrieves relevant context for new queries
- Learns patterns over time

### 3. Comprehensive Evaluation Framework
- 15 test cases across 5 decision categories
- Metrics: Identity Consistency, Memory Usage, Decision Quality
- Statistical significance testing
- Comparative analysis vs RAG baseline

### 4. Academic-Ready Outputs
- Statistical analysis with p-values and effect sizes
- LaTeX table generation for papers
- Visualization plots (bar charts, distributions, heatmaps)
- Comprehensive research summary
