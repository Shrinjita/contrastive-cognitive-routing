# contrastive-cognitive-routing
Real-world AI agent deployments prioritize reliability and control over full autonomy, often relying on fixed task-decomposition workflows. We propose a Contrastive Cognitive Router (CCR), a lightweight adaptive component that selects among bounded task-decomposition protocols—direct, sequential, and parallel—based on query characteristics.
